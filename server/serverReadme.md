This is where the server code should go.

the server code should have security header and stuff implemented for cross site scripting and other exploits.

folder structure

/common  
/app/feature  
/security/feature  
/defaultRoutes  
/errorRoutes  
/endoffile

these will be concatinated togeather to form the server.js app that will be run by nodejs.
